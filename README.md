using TNG50, CANDELS, and zoobot to create a model to identify galaxy mergers near cosmic noon


Steps:

1. Code in TNGstuff  to walk galaxy merger trees and create merger catalogs and mass-matched nonmerger catalogs through time.

2. Mock Image Functions + MakeMocks creates the mock images from the radiatve transfer images.

3. Cutout Backgrounds and Add Backgrounds to create fully realistic mock images.

4. Sort into Training, Validation, and Test Sets

5. Run CNN!
